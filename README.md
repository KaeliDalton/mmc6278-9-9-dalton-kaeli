# Project Name: PetShare

## Description
This website is designed to allow users to share information about their favorite furry friends! It currently offers the main functionality of allowing users to see all the pets we currently host, and add their own pet information. If something doesn't look right or has changed, it also allows them to update their pet information. If you change your mind about posting your pet, you can also remove your pet's entry. The project includes API calls to PlaceKitten and Dog API, for placeholder images of the first pets on our platform.

## Planned Additions
I originally had planned to allow visitors to upload photos of their pets, but due to time constraints, I have not finished that feature yet.

I plan to add placeholder image features for more pet types in the future.

I had also originally planned to incorporate the update and delete functionality through buttons on each pet's page, however, due to time constraints, I have not finished those features. I have included a file with Insomnia data that can be imported so that users can perform Update and Delete functionalities in the meantime.

## Features
Create Custom Pet Entries: Users can create personalized entries by providing their pet's name, and what type of pet they are, with additional fields to provide optional information on their pet's interests.

Generate Placeholder Images: When creating your pet's entry, just designate that they are a cat or that they are a dog, and we'll add a placeholder image to their entry.

API Integration: This project includes an API call to multiple external resources to fetch data, enhancing the overall look of the website.

Multiple Routes: This website is designed with multiple routes for smooth navigation and posting.

## Installation
To set up PetShare on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```git@github.com:KaeliDalton/mmc6278-9-9-dalton-kaeli.git```

Navigate to the project directory:
```cd mmc6278-9-9-dalton-kaeli```

Install the required dependencies:
```npm i```

Start the server:
```npm run dev```

Access the website by opening http://localhost:3000 in your web browser

Currently, the ability to update and delete pets is still limited to HTML requests, so I have included a file with an Insomnia collection's information to aid in using these functions of the site.

Once on our pet list, you can click the link below each pet's information to find out more about them.

If you're feeling inspired by our pet list or a specific pet's profile, you can use the form at the bottom of the page to add your own pet!

From the insomnia collection, you can add, update, or delete information about your pet using HTML requests.
