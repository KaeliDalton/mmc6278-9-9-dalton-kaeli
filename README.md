# Project Name: PetShare
## Description
This website is designed to allow users to share information about their favorite furry friends! It currently offers the main functionality of allowing users to see all the pets we currently host, and add their own pet information. If something doesn't look right or has changed, it also allows them to update their pet information. If you change your mind about posting your pet, you can also remove your pet's entry. The project includes API calls to PlaceKitten and Dog API, for placeholder images of the first pets on our platoform.

## Planned Additions
I originally had planned to allow visitors to upload photos of their pets, but have not finished that feature yet.

I also plan to add placeholder image features for more pet types in the future.

## Features
Create Custom Pet Entries: Users can create personalized posts by providing thier pet's name, and what type of pet they are, with additional fields for their pet's interests.

Generate Placeholder Images: Want to celebrate your cat or dog, but don't have a photo to immediately upload? Just designate that they are a cat or that they are a dog, and we'll add a placeholder image to their entry.

API Integration: This project includes an API call to multiple external resources to fetch data, enhancing the overall look of the website.

Multiple Routes: This website is designed with multiple routes for smooth navigation and posting.
